# Web-Scraping-Articles

The objective of my project is to extract information from the Naval postgraduate school’s website where they have stored thousands of research projects. Their research material is stored in a centralized archive maned Calhoun, that is the Naval Postgraduate School’s digital repository for research materials and institutional publications created by the NPS community. Materials in the Calhoun are openly accessible to anyone on the web and will be preserved for future generations.
This study is focused on web mining, which will be used for extracting data from the web, and once the data is extracted than analysing that data for insights, such as what are the key areas/topics in time and what is the correlation between different authors and which authors have been more active.
